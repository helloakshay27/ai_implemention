# 🔒 SECURITY FIX: Removing API Key from Git History

## ⚠️ Problem
GitHub blocked the push because an OpenAI API key was hardcoded in the repository.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Moved API key to environment variables** (`.env` file)
2. **Updated code** to use `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. **Created `.env.example`** as a template for other developers
4. **Verified `.gitignore`** includes `.env`

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Your API Key is Compromised

**GitHub has detected your API key, which means it's now public!**

### Immediate Action Required:

1. **Revoke the exposed API key** at OpenAI dashboard:
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Find and delete the exposed key: `sk-proj-8PVnSfdZ...`
   - Generate a new API key

2. **Update your local `.env` file** with the new key:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-api-key-here
   ```

## 🔧 How to Fix Git History

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Remove from Git History (Recommended for Clean History)

```bash
# 1. Install git-filter-repo (if not already installed)
# For macOS:
brew install git-filter-repo

# For other systems, see: https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo

# 2. Create a backup
cd /Users/haveninfoline/Desktop/
cp -r ai_implemention-1 ai_implemention-1-backup

# 3. Remove the API key from all commits
cd ai_implemention-1
git filter-repo --path src/services/PublicChatAPI.js --invert-paths --force

# 4. Re-add the fixed file
git add src/services/PublicChatAPI.js .env.example
git commit -m "Security fix: Move API key to environment variables"

# 5. Force push to GitHub
git push origin main --force
```

### Option 2: Simple Fix (Easier, but keeps history)

```bash
# 1. Revoke the old API key on OpenAI platform
# 2. Generate a new API key
# 3. Update .env with the new key

# 4. Amend the last commit to remove the API key
git add src/services/PublicChatAPI.js .env.example
git commit --amend -m "Security fix: Move API key to environment variables"

# 5. Force push
git push origin main --force
```

### Option 3: Allow the Secret (NOT RECOMMENDED)

GitHub provides a URL to allow the secret, but **DO NOT USE THIS** unless:
- The API key has already been revoked
- You have a new key in `.env`
- You understand the security implications

If you still want to proceed:
1. Visit: https://github.com/helloakshay27/ai_implemention/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34h7wEzvXxEvX4SlLhdsD6WQXZP
2. Allow the secret (GitHub will still flag it)

## 📝 Best Practices Going Forward

1. ✅ **Always use environment variables** for API keys
2. ✅ **Never commit `.env` files** (already in `.gitignore`)
3. ✅ **Use `.env.example`** to show required variables
4. ✅ **Rotate API keys** if accidentally exposed
5. ✅ **Use secret scanning** tools before pushing

## 🔄 After Fixing

Once you've cleaned the git history and revoked the old key:

```bash
# 1. Make sure .env has your NEW API key
echo "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-key" > .env

# 2. Verify the code is using environment variables
grep -n "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY" src/services/PublicChatAPI.js

# 3. Test locally
npm run dev

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Security fix: Use environment variables for API keys"
git push origin main
```

## 📚 Files Modified

- `src/services/PublicChatAPI.js` - Now uses `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `.env` - Contains your API key (NOT committed to git)
- `.env.example` - Template for other developers (safe to commit)
- `.gitignore` - Already includes `.env`

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that `.env` file exists and has the correct key
2. Restart the dev server after changing `.env`
3. Make sure you're using Vite (which supports `import.meta.env`)

## ⚡ Quick Start (After Setting Up)

```bash
# 1. Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env and add your API key
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Remember: The exposed API key MUST be revoked immediately to prevent unauthorized usage and charges!**
